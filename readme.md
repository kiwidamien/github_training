# Training repo

This is a repository for training on how to use Github.

For this repo, we will be looking at the boston housing dataset.

Our goal is to make a prediction of what the house price should be based off the features

## Data folder 

The original data is stored at `data/boston_house_prices.csv`

## Jupyter notebook

The Jupyter notebook `Linear_regression_on_housing.ipynb` contains the our analysis. In particular, you can find an estimate of the range of values that the coefficients have (in natural units) in the bootstrapping section.
